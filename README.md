# Settings

This is just a place for me to keep track of my must-have linux customizations.


## Home

Anything in the home folder can be copied directly to `$HOME`. For the aliases to work, you'll need to add `source .bash_aliases` to the end of your `.bashrc`. The `update`, `install`, and `uninstall` aliases are for Arch Linux.

## Awesome WM

If using the Awesome window manager, the awesome folder should be copied to `~/.config/`. The only real differences (as of 11/11/16) are:
+ switching the default terminal to terminator 
+ adding keybindings to use `ctrl + v + .` to increase volume, `ctrl + v + ,` to decrease volume, and `ctrl + v + /` to mute.   
   
(Fair Warning: I may be forgetting something...)
